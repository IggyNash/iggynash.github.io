Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

1. were blocked on a simple problem:

The earliest example that springs to mind is when i was 9 years old and the school room teacher asked me what 3x4 was
I was attempting to quickly do the math in my head but all my classmates kept casting looks of shock and horror and laughing that i didnt immediately know and respond
the embarrassment of this prevented me from being able to take the time to work it out.  Now its forever seared in my memory that the answer is 12.

With coding I have the benefit of being able to do things in my own time (so far)


what was the problem?

I would pick probably an example from the katar excercises, I knew what I wanted to do I just didnt know how to code it.

what problem-solving techniques did you use?

I looked at examples of similiar commands on google to see if I could apply the same logic.
using pseudocode and the rubber ducky method were very helpful
especially with breaking things down into smaller activities.

how did you feel throughout the process?

Dumb, ignorant, a big phony, but I understand that this is to be expected.
I think what my struggle really is, is converting the question or task into the expected response, because usually its actually quite simple.
or in coding, the response desired is short, efficient and eloquently written.
I find myself thinking okay they want this, but how on earth do I begin writing this? Without having done this before, I find a huge build up of frustration.
independant research has been a huge aid in accomplishing this.

what did you learn?

I learned to be patient with myself, my own limitations, and my own ignorance.
Because with each exercise and task I am understanding more, and pushing my boundries and slowly demonstrating capability.


2. elegantly solved a problem.

I'm not sure if there was anything elegant about my outburts at my computer monitor.
I feel sorry for my flatmates hearing my outrage and desperation.
To be honest I would answer the same as the above.


3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

Pseudocode - very helpful, will impliment this in all future coding exercises 
Trying something - I did this a lot, but it usually resulted in a mess and a lot of re-work.
Rubber ducky method - this is great, i normally talk problems outloud anyway, so pretending there is a duck makes me seem less off the rails, (i hope)
Reading error messages - the bane of my coding experience so far.  I hope these are easily fixes in the future.
Console.logging - this is taking some time for me to master, but I definitely see it's value.
Googling - my touchstone.
Asking your peers for help - I have done this scarcely, just due to the response time turn around.  But will be happy to do more of this as the course progresses.
Asking coaches for help - I do this as a last resort after trying all the above, I dont want to appear helpless, but when I have exhuasted all options there really is only this thats left.
Improving your process with reflection

4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?

Probably a generic example I didnt want to expose or reveal my ignorance to others so this made me reluctant, eventually I reahed out for help but also provided an explaination of what I had attempted to solve the problem so that I didnt appear entirely clueless.
It's highly likely that If I am stuck on something then somebody else probably is or has been to, so I can take comfort in that and feel confident asking for help in future.
