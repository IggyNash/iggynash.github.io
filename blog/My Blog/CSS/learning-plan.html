  <h1 class="post-title">My Learning Plan and Final Reflections </h1>

<div class="post-content">
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3> 

    <p>  This isnt just any one thing for me.  Ideally I want a firm understanding of coding as it may open further career paths for me.
        I could see myself working in front-end web development, web design, coding for games or apps, scrum master, agile coach, project coordinator 
        or even back end work like data/business analyst  </p>
        
        <h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        
       <p>  I am logical and itutive and in all my previous roles of employment this has required the development of firm problem solving skills.
        I feel these are transferable skills in any career path and in any learning environment.</p>>


    <h3> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
   
    <p>I would like to be able to understand coding intimately, and be able to recall prompts and commands from memory in html, css, java script..</p>


    <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
    
    <p> I need to limit my distractions, and ensure that I get the sprints done before the end of the course week 6
        be responsive with the learners and fascilitators and not hesitate to reach out if stuck or uncertain.
        When things are building up and starting to get to me I will take a deep breath, take a short break and come at the problems with a fresh perspective.</p>
    
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    
    <p>I will need to not leave problems for the evening or for another day.</p>
    
    <h3> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    
    <p>Understanding of my circumstances and that I have very limited knowledge of the course material prior to commencing.</p>

        <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    
        <p>This course is my only commitment until christmas. </p>

        <h1 class="post-title">Learning Plan Reflections </h1>

        <h3> How accurate were your expectations of your learning needs and growth areas? </h3>

        <p>Not very, in hindsight taking on this course immediately following 4.5 years of full-time employment was a rather ambitious endeavor.  
          My health has not been the greatest and it has impacted on my ability to learn.  Especially understanding that I'm suffering the effects of burnout.  
          Regardless I have put forward the effort that I have been able.  I have loved this course, and I think over the summer I will re-do all of the course material to ensure my comprehension of the learning is where it needs to be 
          and that I am competent and capable of being a full stuck software developer.  I was quite surprised at the pace at which we learned new content that I sometimes worried about retaining the learnings each day/week. 
 
          That being said I have learned so much about coding, and programming with others, pairs and in groups.  I thoroughly enjoy this and look forward to being a part of a close Knitt team.  </p>

          <h3> Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about yourself? </h3>

          <p>I think my ability to problem solve has increased exponentially, especially in a team dynamic.  This has surprised me the most.  Especially the acquisition of a new skillset which is problem solving in pairs. 
            Being able to give suggestions and implement methodologies and problem solving with a partner is a skill you get to practice daily.  
            Which I have enjoyed quite a lot and surprised myself at what I've been able to accomplish through pair programming.  
            I’ve also learned that people enjoy working with me, despite me feeling that my programming skills are underdeveloped.  
            People have regularly provided me with feedback that they enjoy the vibe when paired with me and they enjoy taking on the challenges with me as they feel my personality is easy to get on with 
            which doesn’t place pressure or stress on the daily challenges, that I'm easy to work with and that I don’t push or try to control things or take over.   </p>

            <h3> What challenges did you find in following your learning and wellbeing plan?  </h3>

            <p>The two greatest impediments to my learning plan are  

              (1) Consistency  
              (2) Time management.

              Sometimes my energy levels, headaches, or health have gotten in the way of me being able to put forward a consistent effort with my learning plan. 
              Also, the frequency in which new content is introduced and implemented was a surprise.  Different technologies, different topics, different functions, 
              I am glad that I will be able to review the course material and consolidate my learnings once this has finished, 
              I definitely want to increase my confidence and competency with software programming.
            </p>

            <h3>  

              What benefits did you experience from following your learning and wellbeing plan?   </h3>

              <p>Slowly weaving in the concepts from human skills within my learning plan has been the best addition.  
                Being kind to myself and practicing self-compassion has really helped bring the stress, 
                worry and anxiety levels down whilst also giving me a good mind set to tackle the challenges in my own time. 
                Although I have been quite self-critical with what I had hoped to achieve I still have learned so much about coding, 
                CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Handlebars, React, Typescript, Testing, building an application.  
                When I look back from the inception to the learning plan to writing my review of it I need to celebrate the successes and the learnings I have achieved.  
                Even though this is just the beginning and there is so much more to explore and learn.  
                I think going forward I will revise a new learning plan that is actionable, specific and kind.  
                I'm grateful to Dev Academy for the myriad of skills that have been provided, and I look forward to honing and practicing them all.
