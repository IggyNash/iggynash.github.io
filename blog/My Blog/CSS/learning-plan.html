        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3> 

        <p>  This isnt just any one thing for me.  Ideally I want a firm understanding of coding as it may open further career paths for me.
            I could see myself working in front-end web development, web design, coding for games or apps, scrum master, agile coach, project coordinator 
            or even back end work like data/business analyst  </p>
            
            <h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            
           <p>  I am logical and itutive and in all my previous roles of employment this has required the development of firm problem solving skills.
            I feel these are transferable skills in any career path and in any learning environment.</p>>


        <h3> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
       
        <p>I would like to be able to understand coding intimately, and be able to recall prompts and commands from memory in html, css, java script..</p>


        <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
        
        <p> I need to limit my distractions, and ensure that I get the sprints done before the end of the course week 6
            be responsive with the learners and fascilitators and not hesitate to reach out if stuck or uncertain.
            When things are building up and starting to get to me I will take a deep breath, take a short break and come at the problems with a fresh perspective.</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        
        <p>I will need to not leave problems for the evening or for another day.</p>
        
        <h3> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        
        <p>Understanding of my circumstances and that I have very limited knowledge of the course material prior to commencing.</p>

            <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        
            <p>This course is my only commitment until christmas. </p>
