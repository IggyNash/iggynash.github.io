        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

        <p>1. In the past I would sometimes leave things until the last minute, because I have a self-view that I am highly capable.
            I see that with coding this isnt a practice I can continue.  I am definitely humbled by the exercises.  I see that this takes lots of work, time, effort and patience to master, or even acquire skill in.</p>
            
        <p> 2. I've learned that with patience and perseverance that I can accomplish even the most difficult of tasks.
            and that reaserching topics on the interent is my strongest ally.</p> 
            
        <p> 3. I've learned about different learning methods, and that by mentally practicing things away from the keyboard and monitor I am enchancing my learning.'</p>


        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
       
        <h4>Values:</h4>

           <h5>Ethical Foundation:</h5> <p>Ethical Foundation: Values provide an ethical foundation for decision-making. In programming, ethical considerations are crucial, as developers often handle sensitive data and create systems that impact individuals and society. Having a strong set of values helps developers make responsible and ethical choices in their work.
            
            Consistency and Integrity: Values promote consistency and integrity in coding. Following a set of values, such as clean code principles or the SOLID principles, can lead to more maintainable and robust software. It ensures that code is well-structured and adheres to best practices.
            
            Collaboration: Values like teamwork and cooperation are essential in collaborative development environments. When team members share common values, they can work more effectively together, leading to better outcomes in software development projects.</p> 
            
            <h5>Empathy:</h5><p>User-Centered Design: Empathy is crucial in user-centered design. By understanding the needs and perspectives of end-users, programmers can create software that is more user-friendly and meets real-world requirements. This leads to greater user satisfaction.
            
                Collaboration and Communication: Empathy facilitates effective collaboration and communication. Developers who can empathize with their colleagues can resolve conflicts, provide support, and work well as a team. It's particularly important when working with diverse teams or stakeholders.
                
                Debugging and Problem Solving: Empathy can be a valuable skill in debugging. Understanding how users encounter and describe issues can make it easier to identify and fix problems in software.</p>
            
         
            
            <h5>Ethical Foundation:</h5>Self-Awareness: <p>Learning and Growth: Self-awareness is essential for personal and professional growth. In programming, being aware of one's strengths and weaknesses can help in choosing appropriate learning paths and improving skills.
            
                Productivity and Stress Management: Self-awareness can improve productivity and reduce stress. Recognizing when you're most productive, your work patterns, and signs of burnout can lead to better time management and work-life balance.
                
                Continuous Learning: Self-awareness can drive a programmer's commitment to continuous learning. Being aware of the rapid changes in the technology industry and staying open to learning new tools and techniques is crucial for long-term success.</p>
            

        <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>Proably the human, pro-social skillset required to succeed in coding, I find this aspect appeals to me quite a lot. I think it would be really beneifical if to develop this skillset, especially if I pursue a career as a scrum-master or similiar role.</p>
        
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>This would definitely be task that ask you to do something that you are completely unfamiliar with, or to do something from scratch.  
            I could feel an onset of panic and confusion about where to begin.  It's through researching and discovering auxillary tutorials online that I was able to overcome this.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        
        <p>I assume it's because coding is actually quite difficult and painstaking, it's to prevent mental collapse, promote wellbeing, understanding ourselves as humans so we are in an optimal place to understand code. 
            it's also because its a team setting and a team environment, so being able to build strong rapports and pro-social relations are essential to success.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        
        <p>Yes and no, 
            Yes because I feel I lack so much knowledge and skill in coding, based on where I am at the moment, and I also feel like I can naturally get a long with others, even those that are vastly different to myself.
            No because theres always so much more I can do, learn and improve upon in any aspect of my life.
            it's never a waste of time when both fields of knowledge involve skill aquisition.
