        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

        I once found a $50 note on the floor in the supermarker, Despite wanting to pocket this myself I turned in it to the cahsier,
        I requested that she log in their notes that it was handed in, in their missing items register.
        Although I could have benefited from this situation, I feel much better knowing that it was returned as it was likely belonging to someone who needed it more.


        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
        I was raised in in a strict catholic household which meant Sunday mornings were for church and Sunday afternoon were for community gatherings.
        This was basically a meeting for ecumincal religious families to share, talk, attend teachings and partake in praise and worship.
        Although I am no longer relgious in anyway, I still appreciate the more pro-social forms of social cordination such as fellowship and helping one another.
        I value honesty, peoples time and frienship.


        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        I have a logical yet intuitive approach to problem solving.
        
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        I can be distracted quite easily so I will just have to remind myself to remain on task.
        
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
        The instance that springs to mind is back when I was studying business at AUT.
        We were in a group setting and we had to make a presentation as a group, all members showed up to the first meeting, but the following team meeting it was only attended by myself and one other.
        we divied up the work and did most of it ourselves, and mesasged what still needed to be done to the other memebers.
        Come presentation day our overall mark suffered due to the lack of input from other team members, despite our portions of the presentation being top marked.
        what i would do differently is encourage the other members to be more open with what they struggled with as to be able to help them.
